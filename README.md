# DigitalResume_CampusTraining_STCET_Nullstack

This is my submission of the creation of a website, using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

Index.html contains the code for the resume website, as assigned. 
It is the final assessment in the campus training program (at my college, St. Thomas' College of Engineering & Technology, Kolkata) provided by Nullstack Technologies.

The website has been fully planned and created by me, so it is 100% original. 
The code is my own, and has NOT been stolen/copied from any source on Github or other sites on the Internet.
